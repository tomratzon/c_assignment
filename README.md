# string_manipulation_menu

  Write a program that manipulates one sentence. A sentence is a sequence of words over
  
  an 'A'-'Z' alphabet. A sentence contains at most 30 characters (spaces are not counted;
  
  number of spaces between words in input sentence is not important). In case the input
  
  contains symbols different from 'A'-'Z' or space, ask user to type data again after
  
  following massage:
  
  ERROR: Incorrect data, try again.
  
  A sentence will be held as a single array of characters so that distance between words
  
  in the same array is exactly one space.
  
  The program displays a user menu, reads one out of 10 options (numbers 1 – 10 only)
  
  prints the result of suitable operation and goes back to the display menu.
  
  The menu is:

  
  ******** Main menu ********
  
  1 : Input the sentence
  
  2 : Print the sentence
  
  3: Reverse the sentence
  
  4 : Rotate left N
  
  5 : Rotate right N
  
  6 : Sort the sentence
  
  7 : Search the word
  
  8 : Count number of words
  
  9 : Display substring M
  
  10 :Quit
  
  ****************************
  
  Please, enter your choice >



The program runs until the user chooses the option 10 (Quit).

In case there is an error in the command, the program asks the user to try command

again after following message:

ERROR: Incorrect command, try again.

In case the sentence isn’t initialized and the user choosed commands 2-9 the

following message will appear: ERROR: The sentence is empty.

and the program goes back displaying the menu
